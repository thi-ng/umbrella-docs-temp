## DisjointSet class

Typed array based Disjoint Set implementation with quick union and path compression, after Sedgewick &amp; Wayne.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class DisjointSet 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(n)](./adjacency.disjointset._constructor_.md) |  | Creates new instance with <code>n</code> initial singular subsets. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [count](./adjacency.disjointset.count.md) |  | <code>number</code> |  |
|  [ranks](./adjacency.disjointset.ranks.md) |  | <code>Uint8Array</code> |  |
|  [roots](./adjacency.disjointset.roots.md) |  | <code>Uint32Array</code> |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [canonical(id)](./adjacency.disjointset.canonical.md) |  | Returns canonical ID (tree root) for given <code>id</code>. Unless <code>id</code> already is unified with some other ID, this will always return <code>id</code> itself (since each node is initially its own root). |
|  [subsets()](./adjacency.disjointset.subsets.md) |  | Returns a <code>Map</code> of all subsets (connected components) with their canonical tree root IDs as keys and arrays of node IDs as values. |
|  [unified(a, b)](./adjacency.disjointset.unified.md) |  | Returns true, if the given two nodes belong to the same tree / subset. |
|  [union(a, b)](./adjacency.disjointset.union.md) |  | Connects combines the trees of the given two node IDs and returns the new resulting canonical tree root ID. |

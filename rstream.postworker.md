## postWorker variable

Creates a subscriber which forwards received values to given worker. The `worker` can be an existing `Worker` instance, a JS source code `Blob` or an URL string. In the latter two cases, a worker is created automatically using `utils/makeWorker()`<!-- -->. If `transfer` is true, the received values will be marked as \*transferrable\* and the host app loses all access permissions to the transferred values. See `Worker.postMessage()` for details.

If `terminate` is set to a positive number, then the worker will be automatically terminated after the stated number of milliseconds \*\*after\*\* the parent subscription is done.

```
// worker source code
src = `self.onmessage = (e) => console.log("worker", e.data);`;

a = rs.stream();
a.subscribe(
  rs.postWorker(new Blob([src], {type: "application/javascript"}))
);

a.next(42)
// worker 42

```

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
postWorker: <T>(worker: string | Blob | Worker, transfer?: boolean, terminate?: number) => ISubscriber<T>
```

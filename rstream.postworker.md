## postWorker variable

Creates a [subscriber](./rstream.isubscriber.md) which forwards received values to given worker.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
postWorker: <T>(worker: string | Blob | Worker, transfer?: boolean, terminate?: number) => ISubscriber<T>
```

## Remarks

The `worker` can be an existing `Worker` instance, a JS source code `Blob` or an URL string. In the latter two cases, a worker is created automatically. If `transfer` is true, the received values will be marked as \*transferrable\* and the host app loses all access permissions to these marked values. See `Worker.postMessage()` for details.

If `terminate` is set to a positive number, then the worker will be automatically terminated after the stated number of milliseconds since the parent subscription is [ISubscriber.done](./rstream.isubscriber.done.md)<!-- -->.

## Example


```ts
// worker source code
src = `self.onmessage = (e) => console.log("worker", e.data);`;

a = stream();
a.subscribe(
  postWorker(src, { type: "application/javascript" }))
);

a.next(42)
// worker 42

```

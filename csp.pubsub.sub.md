## PubSub.sub() method

Creates a new topic subscription channel and returns it. Each topic is managed by its own `Mult` and can have arbitrary number of subscribers. If the optional transducer is given, it will only be applied to the new subscription channel.

The special "\*" topic can be used to subscribe to all messages and acts as multiplexed pass-through of the source channel.

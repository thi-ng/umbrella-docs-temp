## releaseTree variable

Recursively attempts to call the `release` lifecycle method on every element in given tree (branch), using depth-first descent. Each element is checked for the presence of the `__release` control attribute. If (and only if) it is set to `false`<!-- -->, further descent into that element's branch is skipped.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
releaseTree: (tag: any) => void
```

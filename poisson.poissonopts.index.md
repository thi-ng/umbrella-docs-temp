## PoissonOpts.index property

Spatial indexing implementation for nearest neighbor searches of candidate points. Currently only  is available and must be pre-initialized to given dimensions prior to calling [samplePoisson](./poisson.samplepoisson.md)<!-- -->.

The data structure is used to store all successful sample points (as keys) incl. their exclusion radius (as value).

Furthermore, pre-seeding the data structure allows already indexed points to participate in the sampling process and act as exclusion zones. It also can be used as mechanism for progressive sampling, i.e. generating a large number of samples and distributing the process over multiple invocations of smaller sample sizes (see `max` option) to avoid long delays.

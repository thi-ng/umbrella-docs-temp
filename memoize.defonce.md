## defonce variable

Lightweight named singleton factory, intended for hot-module replacement situations. Takes a (preferably globally unique) `id` and `factory` function. If there's no value defined for `id` yet, calls `factory` to produce the singleton value and caches it. Returns singleton value.

Note: All created values will remain in the private cache until the JS process terminates or this module itself has been reloaded (though the latter shouldn't happen in an HMR workflow).

```typescript
defonce: <T>(id: string, factory: Fn0<T>) => T
```

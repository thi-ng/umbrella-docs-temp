## resolve-map package

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [absPath](./resolve-map.abspath.md) | Takes the path for the current key and a lookup path string. Converts the possibly relative lookup path into its absolute form. |
|  [resolve](./resolve-map.resolve.md) | Visits all key-value pairs or array items in depth-first order, expands any reference values, mutates the original object and returns it. Cyclic references are not allowed and will throw an error. However, refs pointing to other refs are recursively resolved (again, provided there are no cycles).<!-- -->Reference values are special strings representing lookup paths of other values in the object and are prefixed with <code>@</code> for relative refs or <code>@/</code> for absolute refs and both using <code>/</code> as path separator (Note: trailing slashes are NOT allowed!). Relative refs are resolved from the currently visited object and support "../" prefixes to access any parent levels. Absolute refs are always resolved from the root level (the original object passed to this function). |

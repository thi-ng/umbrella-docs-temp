## cond variable

Higher order word. Takes two stack programs: truthy and falsey branches, respectively. When executed, pops TOS and runs only one of the branches depending if TOS was truthy or not.

Note: Unlike JS `if() {...} else {...}` constructs, the actual conditional is NOT part of this word.

( bool -- ? )

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
cond: (_then: StackProc, _else?: StackProc) => (ctx: StackContext) => StackContext
```

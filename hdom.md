## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ComponentAttribs](./hdom.componentattribs.md) |  |
|  [HDOMBehaviorAttribs](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.md) |  |
|  [HDOMImplementation](./hdom.hdomimplementation.md) | This interface defines the underlying target update operations used by <code>diffTree()</code> and <code>createDOM()</code>. It allows  to be used as general purpose tree definition &amp; differential update mechanism, rather than being restricted to only work with an HTML DOM. See [DEFAULT\_IMPL](./hdom.default_impl.md) for the default implementations dealing with the latter. Note: Depending on use case and tree configuration, not all of these methods are required.<!-- -->Custom element-local implementations can also be provided via the special <code>__impl</code> hdom element/component attribute. In this case the element itself and all of its children will be processed with those custom operations. |
|  [HDOMOpts](./hdom.hdomopts.md) |  |
|  [ILifecycle](./hdom.ilifecycle.md) |  |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [addChild](./hdom.addchild.md) |  |
|  [clearDOM](./hdom.cleardom.md) |  |
|  [cloneWithNewAttribs](./hdom.clonewithnewattribs.md) |  |
|  [createElement](./hdom.createelement.md) | Creates a new DOM element of type <code>tag</code> with optional <code>attribs</code>. If <code>parent</code> is not <code>null</code>, the new element will be inserted as child at given <code>insert</code> index. If <code>insert</code> is missing, the element will be appended to the <code>parent</code>'s list of children. Returns new DOM node.<!-- -->If <code>tag</code> is a known SVG element name, the new element will be created with the proper SVG XML namespace. |
|  [createTextElement](./hdom.createtextelement.md) |  |
|  [createTree](./hdom.createtree.md) | See <code>HDOMImplementation</code> interface for further details. |
|  [DEFAULT\_IMPL](./hdom.default_impl.md) | Default target implementation to manipulate browser DOM. |
|  [diffAttributes](./hdom.diffattributes.md) | Helper function for <code>diffTree()</code> to compute &amp; apply the difference between a node's <code>prev</code> and <code>curr</code> attributes. |
|  [diffTree](./hdom.difftree.md) | See <code>HDOMImplementation</code> interface for further details. |
|  [equiv](./hdom.equiv.md) | Customized version [equiv](./equiv.equiv.md) which takes <code>__diff</code> attributes into account (at any nesting level). If an hdom element's attribute object contains <code>__diff: false</code>, the object will ALWAYS be considered unequal, even if all other attributes in the object are equivalent. |
|  [getChild](./hdom.getchild.md) |  |
|  [hydrateTree](./hdom.hydratetree.md) | See <code>HDOMImplementation</code> interface for further details. |
|  [LOGGER](./hdom.logger.md) |  |
|  [normalizeElement](./hdom.normalizeelement.md) | Expands single hiccup element/component into its canonical form:
```
[tagname, {attribs}, ...children]

```
Emmet-style ID and class names in the original tagname are moved into the attribs object, e.g.:
```
["div#foo.bar.baz"] => ["div", {id: "foo", class: "bar baz"}]

```
If both Emmet-style classes AND a <code>class</code> attrib exists, the former are appended to the latter:
```
["div.bar.baz", {class: "foo"}] => ["div", {class: "foo bar baz"}]

```
Elements with <code>__skip</code> attrib enabled and no children, will have an empty text child element injected. |
|  [normalizeTree](./hdom.normalizetree.md) | See <code>HDOMImplementation</code> interface for further details. |
|  [releaseTree](./hdom.releasetree.md) | Recursively attempts to call the <code>release</code> lifecycle method on every element in given tree (branch), using depth-first descent. Each element is checked for the presence of the <code>__release</code> control attribute. If (and only if) it is set to <code>false</code>, further descent into that element's branch is skipped. |
|  [removeAttribs](./hdom.removeattribs.md) |  |
|  [removeChild](./hdom.removechild.md) |  |
|  [removeListener](./hdom.removelistener.md) | Removes event listener (possibly with options). |
|  [renderOnce](./hdom.renderonce.md) | One-off hdom tree conversion &amp; target DOM application. Takes same options as <code>start()</code>, but performs no diffing and only creates or hydrates target once. The given tree is first normalized and if result is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> no further action will be taken. |
|  [replaceChild](./hdom.replacechild.md) |  |
|  [resolveRoot](./hdom.resolveroot.md) |  |
|  [setAttrib](./hdom.setattrib.md) | Sets a single attribute on given element. If attrib name is NOT an event name (prefix: "on") and its value is a function, it is called with given <code>attribs</code> object (usually the full attrib object passed to <code>setAttribs</code>) and the function's return value is used as the actual attrib value.<!-- -->Special rules apply for certain attributes:<!-- -->- "style": delegated to <code>setStyle()</code> - "value": delegated to <code>updateValueAttrib()</code> - attrib IDs starting with "on" are treated as event listeners<!-- -->If the given (or computed) attrib value is <code>false</code> or <code>undefined</code> the attrib is removed from the element. |
|  [setAttribs](./hdom.setattribs.md) |  |
|  [setContent](./hdom.setcontent.md) |  |
|  [setListener](./hdom.setlistener.md) | Adds event listener (possibly with options). |
|  [setLogger](./hdom.setlogger.md) |  |
|  [setStyle](./hdom.setstyle.md) |  |
|  [start](./hdom.start.md) | Takes an hiccup tree (array, function or component object w/ life cycle methods) and an optional object of DOM update options. Starts RAF update loop, in each iteration first normalizing given tree, then computing diff to previous frame's tree and applying any changes to the real DOM. The <code>ctx</code> option can be used for passing arbitrary config data or state down into the hiccup component tree. Any embedded component function in the tree will receive this context object (shallow copy) as first argument, as will life cycle methods in component objects. If the <code>autoDerefKeys</code> option is given, attempts to auto-expand/deref the given keys in the user supplied context object (<code>ctx</code> option) prior to \*each\* tree normalization. All of these values should implement the [IDeref](./api.ideref.md) interface (e.g. atoms, cursors, views, rstreams etc.). This feature can be used to define dynamic contexts linked to the main app state, e.g. using derived views provided by .<!-- -->\*\*Selective updates\*\*: No updates will be applied if the given hiccup tree is <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> or a root component function returns no value. This way a given root function can do some state handling of its own and implement fail-fast checks to determine no DOM updates are necessary, save effort re-creating a new hiccup tree and request skipping DOM updates via this function. In this case, the previous DOM tree is kept around until the root function returns a tree again, which then is diffed and applied against the previous tree kept as usual. Any number of frames may be skipped this way.<!-- -->\*\*Important:\*\* Unless the <code>hydrate</code> option is enabled, the parent element given is assumed to have NO children at the time when <code>start()</code> is called. Since hdom does NOT track the real DOM, the resulting changes will result in potentially undefined behavior if the parent element wasn't empty. Likewise, if <code>hydrate</code> is enabled, it is assumed that an equivalent DOM (minus listeners) already exists (i.e. generated via SSR) when <code>start()</code> is called. Any other discrepancies between the pre-existing DOM and the hdom trees will cause undefined behavior.<!-- -->Returns a function, which when called, immediately cancels the update loop. |
|  [updateValueAttrib](./hdom.updatevalueattrib.md) | Updates an element's <code>value</code> property. For form elements it too ensures the edit cursor retains its position. |

## adsr variable

Time based ADSR envelope gen with customizable exponential attack, decay and release curves.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
adsr: (opts?: Partial<ADSROpts> | undefined) => ADSR
```

## Remarks

The attack, decay and release options are to be given in samples (`num = time_in_seconds * sample_rate`<!-- -->). Unless the sustain length (`slen` opt) is finite (default: âˆž), the release phase of the envelope MUST be triggered manually by calling [ADSR.release()](./dsp.adsr.release.md)<!-- -->. If only attack &amp; decay phases are required, initialize the sustain level to zero and configure `dcurve` to adjust falloff shape.

The envelope can be re-used &amp; restarted by calling [ADSR.reset()](./dsp.adsr.reset.md)<!-- -->. This will move the internal state back to the beginning of the attack phase and start producing a new envelope with current settings. Note: Any changes done to the envelope parameters are only guaranteed to be fully applied after reset.

The `acurve` and `dcurve` options can be used to control the exponential curvature of the attack, decay and release phases. Recommended range \[0.0001 - 100\] (curved -<!-- -->&gt; linear).

## converge() function

Transducer which for each input `x` (apart from the very first one) applies given predicate `pred` to previous input and `x`<!-- -->. Only passes values downstream as long as the predicate returns a falsy result. Once the result is truthy, `x` is considered converged and the transformation is terminated (by emitting a [reduced](./transducers.reduced.md) value).

This can be used to limit processing of inputs only as long as there're noticeable changes (according to the predicate) and then stop the transducer pipeline once results have converged.

```
// process as long as difference to prev value is >= 0.01
[...converge(
      // predicate
      (a, b) => Math.abs(a - b) < 0.01,
      // input sequence
      iterate((x, i) => x + Math.pow(2, -i), 0)
)]
// [ 0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, 0.9375, 0.96875, 0.984375, 0.9921875 ]

## sidechainPartition variable

Buffers values from `src` until side chain fires, then emits buffer (unless empty) and repeats process until either input is done. By default, the value read from the side chain is ignored, however the optional predicate can be used to only trigger for specific values / conditions.

```
// merge various event streams
events = merge([
    fromEvent(document,"mousemove"),
    fromEvent(document,"mousedown"),
    fromEvent(document,"mouseup")
]);

// queue event processing to only execute during the
// requestAnimationFrame cycle (RAF)
events.subscribe(sidechainPartition(fromRAF())).subscribe(trace())

```

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
sidechainPartition: <A, B>(side: ISubscribable<B>, pred?: import("@thi.ng/api").Fn<B, boolean> | undefined, id?: string | undefined) => Subscription<A, A[]>
```

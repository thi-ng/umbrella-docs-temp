## buttonGroup variable

Higher order function to create a new stateless button group component, pre-configured via user supplied options. The returned component function accepts the following arguments:

- hdom context object (unused) - partial `ButtonGroupArgs` object (extra attribs, disabled flag) - button group items (varargs)

Any `attribs` provided as arg via `ButtonGroupArgs` are merged with the default options provided to the HOF. If `disabled` is true, ALL buttons in the group will be disabled, regardless of their individual settings. The group can have any number of elements, given as varargs.

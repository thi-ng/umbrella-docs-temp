[Home](./index.md) &gt; [@thi.ng/rstream](./rstream.md) &gt; [fromRAF](./rstream.fromraf.md)

## fromRAF variable

Yields [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of a monotonically increasing counter, triggered by a `requestAnimationFrame()` loop (only available in browser environments).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromRAF: (opts?: Partial<CommonOpts> | undefined) => Stream<number>
```

## Remarks

In NodeJS, this function falls back to [fromInterval](./rstream.frominterval.md)<!-- -->, yielding a similar (approx. 60Hz) stream.

All subscribers to this stream will be processed during that same loop iteration.

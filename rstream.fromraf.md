## fromRAF variable

Yields a stream of monotonically increasing counter, triggered by a `requestAnimationFrame()` loop (only available in browser environments). In NodeJS, this function falls back to `fromInterval(16)`<!-- -->, yielding a similar (approximately 60fps) stream.

Subscribers to this stream will be processed during that same loop iteration.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromRAF: () => Stream<number>
```

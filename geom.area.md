## area variable

Returns the possibly signed (unsigned by default) surface area of given `shape`<!-- -->. For groups calls [area](./geom.area.md) for each child and returns sum of unsigned areas.

In general, for polygons and triangles, the sign of the result can be used as indication of the shapes orientation (clockwise / counterclockwise).

For curves, lines, point clouds and rays the function returns 0.

Implemented for:

- AABB - Circle - Cubic - Ellipse - Group - Line - Plane - Points - Polygon - Polyline - Quad - Quadratic - Ray - Rect - Sphere - Triangle

## dip variable

Removes `x` from d-stack, calls `q` and restores `x` to the top of the d-stack after quotation is finished.

( x q -- x )

Same behavior as: `[swap, movdr, exec, movrd]`<!-- -->, only the current implementation doesn't use r-stack and stashes `x` off stack.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dip: (ctx: StackContext) => StackContext
```

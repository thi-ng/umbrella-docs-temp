## ILifecycle.render() method

Returns the hdom tree of this component. Note: Always will be called first (prior to `init`<!-- -->/`release`<!-- -->) to obtain the actual component definition used for diffing. Therefore might have to include checks if any local state has already been initialized via `init`<!-- -->. This is the only mandatory method which MUST be implemented.

`render` is executed before `init` because `normalizeTree()` must obtain the component's hdom tree first before it can determine if an `init` is necessary. `init` itself will be called from `diffTree`<!-- -->, `createDOM` or `hydrateDOM()` in a later phase of processing.

`render` should ALWAYS return an array or another function, else the component's `init` or `release` fns will NOT be able to be called later. E.g. If the return value of `render` evaluates as a string or number, the return value should be wrapped as `["span", "foo"]`<!-- -->. If no `init` or `release` are used, this requirement is relaxed.

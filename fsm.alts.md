## alts variable

Returns a composed matcher which applies inputs to all given child matchers (`opts`<!-- -->) until either all have failed or one of them returns a full match.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
alts: <T, C, R>(opts: Matcher<T, C, R>[], fallback?: import("./api").SeqCallback<T, C, R> | undefined, success?: AltCallback<T, C, R> | undefined, fail?: import("./api").SeqCallback<T, C, R> | undefined) => Matcher<T, C, R>
```

## Remarks

If successful, calls `callback` with the context, the child matcher's result and an array of all processed inputs thus far. The result of `alts` is the result of this callback (else undefined).

If none of the matchers succeed the optional `fallback` callback will be executed and given a chance to produce a state transition. It too will be given an array of all processed inputs thus far.

Note: Matchers are always processed in reverse order, therefore attention must be paid to the given ordering of supplied matchers.

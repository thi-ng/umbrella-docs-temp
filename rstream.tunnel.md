## tunnel variable

Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which processes received values via the configured worker(s) and then passes values received back from the worker(s) downstream, thereby allowing workers to be used transparently for stream processing.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
tunnel: <A, B>(opts: TunnelOpts<A>) => Tunnel<A, B>
```

## Remarks

Multiple worker instances are supported for concurrent processing. See the [TunnelOpts](./rstream.tunnelopts.md) for details.

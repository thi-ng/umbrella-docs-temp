## mapl variable

Generic array transformer.

( arr q -- ? )

Pops both args from d-stack, then executes quotation for each array item (each pushed on d-stack prior to calling quotation). Can produce any number of results and therefore also be used as filter, mapcat, reduce...

```
// each item times 10
run([[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, mul], mapl])
// [ [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ], [], {} ]

```
Use for filtering:

```
// drop even numbers, duplicate odd ones
run([[1, 2, 3, 4], [dup, even, cond(drop, dup)], mapl])
// [ [ 1, 1, 3, 3 ], [], {} ]

```
Reduction:

```
// the `0` is the initial reduction result
runU([0, [1, 2, 3, 4], [add], mapl])
// 10

```
\*\*Important\*\*: [mapl](./pointfree.mapl.md) does not produce a result array. However, there're several options to collect results as array, e.g.

Use [mapll](./pointfree.mapll.md) to transform:

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
mapl: (ctx: StackContext) => StackContext
```

## Example 1


```ts
runU([[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, mul], mapll])
// [ 10, 20, 30, 40]

```
Collecting results as array is a form of reduction, so we can use [list](./pointfree.list.md) to produce an initial new array and [pushr](./pointfree.pushr.md) to push each new interim value into the result:

## Example 2


```ts
runU([list, [1, 2, 3, 4], [10, mul, pushr], mapl])
// [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]

```
If the array size is known &amp; not changed by transformation:

## Example 3


```ts
runU([[1, 2, 3, 4], [10, mul], mapl, 4, collect])
// [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]

```

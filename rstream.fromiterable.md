## fromIterable variable

Creates a new [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of given iterable which asynchronously calls `.next()` for each item of the iterable when the first (and in this case the only one) subscriber becomes available. The values are processed via `setInterval()` using the given `delay` value (default: 0). Once the iterable is exhausted (if finite), then calls `.done()` by default, but can be avoided by passing `false` as last argument.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromIterable: <T>(src: Iterable<T>, delay?: number, close?: boolean) => Stream<T>
```

## ILifecycle interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface ILifecycle 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [init(el, ctx, args)](./hdom.ilifecycle.init.md) | Component init method. Called with the actual DOM element, hdom user context and any other args when the component is first used, but \*\*after\*\* <code>render()</code> has been called once already AND all of the components children have been realized. Therefore, if any children have their own <code>init</code> lifecycle method, these hooks will be executed before that of the parent. |
|  [release(ctx, args)](./hdom.ilifecycle.release.md) | Called when the underlying DOM of this component is removed (or replaced). Intended for cleanup tasks. |
|  [render(ctx, args)](./hdom.ilifecycle.render.md) | Returns the hdom tree of this component. Note: Always will be called first (prior to <code>init</code>/<code>release</code>) to obtain the actual component definition used for diffing. Therefore might have to include checks if any local state has already been initialized via <code>init</code>. This is the only mandatory method which MUST be implemented.<code>render</code> is executed before <code>init</code> because <code>normalizeTree()</code> must obtain the component's hdom tree first before it can determine if an <code>init</code> is necessary. <code>init</code> itself will be called from <code>diffTree</code>, <code>createDOM</code> or <code>hydrateDOM()</code> in a later phase of processing.<code>render</code> should ALWAYS return an array or another function, else the component's <code>init</code> or <code>release</code> fns will NOT be able to be called later. E.g. If the return value of <code>render</code> evaluates as a string or number, the return value should be wrapped as <code>[&quot;span&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;]</code>. If no <code>init</code> or <code>release</code> are used, this requirement is relaxed. |

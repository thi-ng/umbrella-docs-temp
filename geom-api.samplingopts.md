## SamplingOpts interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface SamplingOpts 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [dist](./geom-api.samplingopts.dist.md) | <code>number</code> | Approximate desired distance between sampled result points. If given, takes priority over the <code>num</code> option, but the latter MIGHT be used as part of the sampling process (implementation specific). |
|  [last](./geom-api.samplingopts.last.md) | <code>boolean</code> | If <code>true</code>, the shape's end point will be included in the result array. The default setting for open geometries is <code>true</code>, for closed ones <code>false</code>. This option has no influence on any internal resolution calculation.<!-- -->For open geometry this option is useful to when re-sampling paths of consecutive segments, where the end points of each segment coincide with the start points of the next segment. For all but the last segment, this option should be <code>false</code> and so can be used to avoid duplicate vertices in the concatenated result.<!-- -->When sampling closed shapes, enabling this option will include an extra point (start), i.e. if the <code>num</code> option was given, results in <code>num+1</code> points. |
|  [num](./geom-api.samplingopts.num.md) | <code>number</code> | Number of points to sample &amp; return. Defaults to the implementing type's default samples if neither this nor <code>theta</code> option is given. |
|  [theta](./geom-api.samplingopts.theta.md) | <code>number</code> | Defines the target angle between sampled points. If greater than the actual range of the arc, only the two end points will be returned at most. This option is used to derive a <code>num</code> value and takes priority if <code>num</code> is given as well.<!-- -->This option is useful to adapt the sampling based on angular resolution, rather than a fixed number of samples. |

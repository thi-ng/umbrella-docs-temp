## splice variable

Forms a new strings which inserts given `insert` string into `src` string at `from` position and appends remaining `src` chars from original `to` position. If `from` and `to` are equal (`to` by default is), the operation is a pure insertion. If not, then some chars from `src` will be removed in the new string. If either position is negative, it'll be considered relative to the end of the `src`<!-- -->.

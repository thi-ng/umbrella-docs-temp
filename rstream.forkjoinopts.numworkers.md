## ForkJoinOpts.numWorkers property

Optional max number of workers to use. Defaults to `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (or if unavailable, then 4 as fallback). If setting this higher, be aware of browser limits and potential resulting crashes!

If using multiple `forkJoin`<!-- -->s concurrently, it's the user's responsibility to ensure that the total number of workers won't exceed the browser limit (Chome/FF \~20).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
numWorkers?: number;
```

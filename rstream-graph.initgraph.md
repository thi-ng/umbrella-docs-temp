## initGraph variable

Dataflow graph initialization function. Takes a state Atom (or `null` if not needed) and an object of `NodeSpec` values or functions returning `Node` objects. Calls `nodeFromSpec` for each spec and then recursively resolves references via . Returns new initialized graph object of `Node` objects and  stream constructs. Does NOT mutate original `GraphSpec` object.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
initGraph: (state: IAtom<any>, spec: IObjectOf<Node | import("@thi.ng/api").Fn<ResolveFn, Node> | NodeSpec>) => IObjectOf<Node>
```

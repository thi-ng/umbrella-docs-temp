## EventBus.processQueue() method

Triggers processing of current event queue and returns `true` if the any of the processed events caused a state change.

If an event handler triggers the `FX_DISPATCH_NOW` side effect, the new event will be added to the currently processed batch and therefore executed in the same frame. Also see [dispatchNow](./interceptors.dispatchnow.md)<!-- -->.

If the optional `ctx` arg is provided it will be merged into the [InterceptorContext](./interceptors.interceptorcontext.md) object passed to each interceptor. Since the merged object is also used to collect triggered side effects, care must be taken that there're no key name clashes.

In order to use the built-in `EV_UNDO`<!-- -->, `EV_REDO` events, users MUST provide a [History](./atom.history.md) (or compatible undo history instance) via the `ctx` arg, e.g.

```
bus.processQueue({ history });

```

<b>Signature:</b>

## pinkNoise variable

Pink noise generator with customizable frequency distribution. The default config produces a power spectrum roughly following the `1/f` pink characteristic.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
pinkNoise: (gain?: number | undefined, rnd?: IRandom | undefined, amp?: Tuple<number, 5> | undefined, prob?: Tuple<number, 5> | undefined) => PinkNoise
```

## Remarks

Custom frequency/power distributions can be obtained by providing `amp` and `prob`<!-- -->ability tuples for the 5 internal bins used to compute the noise. `amp` defines per-bin power contributions, the latter bin update probabilities.

Resulting noise values are normalized to given `gain`<!-- -->, which itself is scale relative to the sum of given `amp` values.

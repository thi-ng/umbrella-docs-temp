## HDOMBehaviorAttribs interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface HDOMBehaviorAttribs 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [\_\_diff](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__diff.md) | <code>boolean</code> | HDOM behavior control attribute. If true (default), the element will be fully processed by <code>diffTree()</code>. If false, no diff will be computed and the <code>replaceChild()</code> operation will be called in the currently active hdom target implementation. |
|  [\_\_impl](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__impl.md) | <code>HDOMImplementation&lt;any&gt;</code> | HDOM behavior control attribute. If present, the element and all of its children will be processed by the given <code>HDOMImplementation</code> instead of the default implementation. |
|  [\_\_normalize](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__normalize.md) | <code>boolean</code> | HDOM behavior control attribute. If <code>false</code>, the current element's children will not be normalized. Use this when you're sure that all children are already in canonical format (incl. <code>key</code> attributes). See <code>normalizeTree()</code> for details. |
|  [\_\_release](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__release.md) | <code>boolean</code> | HDOM behavior control attribute. If <code>false</code>, hdom will not attempt to call <code>release()</code> lifecycle methods on this element or any of its children. |
|  [\_\_serialize](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__serialize.md) | <code>boolean</code> | Currently only used by [@thi.ng/hiccup](./hiccup.md)<!-- -->. No relevance for hdom. If <code>false</code>, the element and its children will be omitted from the serialized result. |
|  [\_\_skip](./hdom.hdombehaviorattribs.__skip.md) | <code>boolean</code> | HDOM behavior control attribute. If true, the element will not be diffed and simply skipped. IMPORTANT: This attribute is only intended for cases when a component / tree branch should not be updated, but MUST NEVER be enabled when that component is first included in the tree. Doing so will result in undefined future behavior.<!-- -->Note, skipped elements and their children are being normalized, but are ignored during diffing. Therefore, if this attribute is enabled the element should either have no children OR the children are the same (type) as when the attribute is disabled (i.e. when <code>__skip</code> is falsy). |

## ensureStateLessThan variable

Specialization of `ensurePred()` to ensure a state value is less than given max at the time when the event is being processed. The optional `path` fn is used to extract or produce the path for the state value to be validated. If omitted, the event's payload item is interpreted as the value path.

For example, without a provided `path` function and for an event of this form: `["event-id", "foo.bar"]`<!-- -->, the term `"foo.bar"` would be interpreted as path.

If the event has this shape: `["event-id", ["foo.bar", 23]]`<!-- -->, we must provide `(e) => e[1][0]` as path function to extract `"foo.bar"` from the event.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ensureStateLessThan: (max: number, path?: Fn<Event, Path> | undefined, err?: InterceptorFn | undefined) => InterceptorFn
```

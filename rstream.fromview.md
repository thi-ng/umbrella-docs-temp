## fromView variable

Similar to [fromAtom](./rstream.fromatom.md)<!-- -->, but creates an eager derived view for a nested value in atom / cursor and yields stream of its value changes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromView: <T>(atom: ReadonlyAtom<any>, opts: FromViewOpts<T>) => Stream<T>
```

## Remarks

Views are readonly and more lightweight versions of [cursors](./atom.cursor.md)<!-- -->. The view checks for value changes with given `equiv` predicate ([equiv](./equiv.equiv.md) by default). If the predicate returns a falsy result, the new value is emitted on the stream. The first value emitted is always the (possibly transformed) current value at the stream's start time (i.e. when the first subscriber attaches).

If the `tx` option is given, the raw value is first passed to this transformer function and its result emitted on the stream instead.

When the stream is cancelled the view is destroyed as well.

## Example


```ts
db = new Atom({ a: 1, b: { c: 2 }});

fromView(
  db,
  {
    path: "b.c",
    tx: (x) => x != null ? x : "n/a"
}).subscribe(trace("view:"))
// view: 2

db.swapIn("b.c", (x: number) => x + 1);
// view: 3

db.reset({ a: 10 });
// view: n/a

```

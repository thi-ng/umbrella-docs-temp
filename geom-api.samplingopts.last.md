## SamplingOpts.last property

If `true`<!-- -->, the shape's end point will be included in the result array. The default setting for open geometries is `true`<!-- -->, for closed ones `false`<!-- -->. This option has no influence on any internal resolution calculation.

For open geometry this option is useful to when re-sampling paths of consecutive segments, where the end points of each segment coincide with the start points of the next segment. For all but the last segment, this option should be `false` and so can be used to avoid duplicate vertices in the concatenated result.

When sampling closed shapes, enabling this option will include an extra point (start), i.e. if the `num` option was given, results in `num+1` points.

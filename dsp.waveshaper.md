## waveShaper variable

Customizable wave shaper for user defined shaping function supporting one (optional, implementation specific) adjustable curve parameter. By default uses [waveshapeTan](./dsp.waveshapetan.md) and supports configurable curvature. Post-amplification is applied to the transformed result value (see remarks).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
waveShaper: (thresh?: number | undefined, amp?: number | true | undefined, map?: Fn2<number, number, number> | undefined) => WaveShaper
```

## Remarks

If `amp` is `true` (default), the curve will be normalized such that input values in the \[-1 .. 1\] range will be mapped to the same output interval.

The following wave shaping functions are supplied by default:

- [waveshapeTan](./dsp.waveshapetan.md) - [waveshapeSigmoid](./dsp.waveshapesigmoid.md) - [waveshapeSin](./dsp.waveshapesin.md)

## forkJoin variable

Returns a [StreamSync](./rstream.streamsync.md) instance which creates &amp; attaches multiple subscriptions to given `src` input stream, processes each received value in parallel via web workers, then recombines partial results and passes the resulting transformed value downstream.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
forkJoin: <IN, MSG, RES, OUT>(opts: ForkJoinOpts<IN, MSG, RES, OUT>) => Subscription<any, OUT>
```

## Remarks

See [ForkJoinOpts](./rstream.forkjoinopts.md) for further details &amp; behavior options and the [forkBuffer](./rstream.forkbuffer.md) and [joinBuffer](./rstream.joinbuffer.md) helpers for array-based value processing (most likely use case).

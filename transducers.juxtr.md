## juxtR() function

Composes a new reducer from the ones given, in order to produce multiple reductions in parallel from the same input. The returned reducer produces a result tuple of reduction results, one per reducer. If any of the reducers returns a [reduced](./transducers.reduced.md) result, the reduction process stops for all others too. `juxtR` produces optimized versions for up to 3 reducer args, but can support any number of reducers.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function juxtR<A1, B>(r1: Reducer<A1, B>): Reducer<[A1], B>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  r1 | <code>Reducer&lt;A1, B&gt;</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Reducer<[A1], B>`

## Example


```ts
reduce(juxtR(add(), reductions(add()), str("-")), [1, 2, 3, 4]);
// [ 10, [ 0, 1, 3, 6, 10 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ]

```

## HDOMBehaviorAttribs.\_\_skip property

HDOM behavior control attribute. If true, the element will not be diffed and simply skipped. IMPORTANT: This attribute is only intended for cases when a component / tree branch should not be updated, but MUST NEVER be enabled when that component is first included in the tree. Doing so will result in undefined future behavior.

Note, skipped elements and their children are being normalized, but are ignored during diffing. Therefore, if this attribute is enabled the element should either have no children OR the children are the same (type) as when the attribute is disabled (i.e. when `__skip` is falsy).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
__skip?: boolean;
```

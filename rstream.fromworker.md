## fromWorker variable

Returns a [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) which adds `message` and `error` event listeners to given `worker` and then emits received values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromWorker: <T>(worker: string | Blob | Worker, opts?: Partial<FromWorkerOpts> | undefined) => Stream<T>
```

## Remarks

If `terminate` is true (default), the worker will be terminated when the stream is being closed (either directly or indirectly, i.e. if the user called [ISubscriber.done](./rstream.isubscriber.done.md) on the stream or the last child subscription has unsubscribed, depending on [config options](./rstream.commonopts.md)<!-- -->).

As with [postWorker](./rstream.postworker.md)<!-- -->, the `worker` can be an existing `Worker` instance, a JS source code `Blob` or an URL string. In the latter two cases, a worker is created automatically.

## Example


```ts


```

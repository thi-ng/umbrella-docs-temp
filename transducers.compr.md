## compR variable

Reducer composition helper, internally used by various transducers during initialization. Takes existing reducer `rfn` (a 3-tuple) and a reducing function `fn`<!-- -->. Returns a new reducer tuple.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
compR: <A, B, C>(rfn: Reducer<A, B>, fn: ReductionFn<A, C>) => Reducer<A, C>
```

## Remarks

`rfn[2]` reduces values of type `B` into an accumulator of type `A`<!-- -->. `fn` accepts values of type `C` and produces interim results of type `B`<!-- -->, which are then (possibly) passed to the "inner" `rfn[2]` function. Therefore the resulting reducer takes inputs of `C` and an accumulator of type `A`<!-- -->.

It is assumed that `fn` internally calls `rfn[2]` to pass its own results for further processing by the nested reducer `rfn`<!-- -->.

## Example


```ts
compR(rfn, fn)
// [rfn[0], rfn[1], fn]

```

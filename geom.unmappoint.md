## unmapPoint variable

Projects given point `uv` (normalized coords) into the target space defined by `shape` and writes result to `out` (or returns new vector). See [mapPoint](./geom.mappoint.md) for reverse operation. Both functions together can be used to warp points from one shape into another.

Currently only implemented for these shape types:

- AABB - Quad - Rect

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
unmapPoint: MultiFn2O<IShape, ReadonlyVec, Vec, Vec>
```

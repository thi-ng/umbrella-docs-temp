## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [comp(a)](./compose.comp.md) | Returns the right-to-left composition of given functions. I.e. when the composed function is called, the given right most function is called first (supports any number of args) and its return value then used as sole argument for the next function etc. Eventually returns result of left-most function. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [compI](./compose.compi.md) |  |
|  [constantly](./compose.constantly.md) |  |
|  [delay](./compose.delay.md) |  |
|  [delayed](./compose.delayed.md) |  |
|  [identity](./compose.identity.md) |  |
|  [ifDef](./compose.ifdef.md) | Returns f(x) iff <code>x</code> is not null or undefined. |
|  [promisify](./compose.promisify.md) | Takes a function accepting a NodeJS-like callback w/ (error, result) args and converts it into a Promise, e.g. for use in async contexts. |
|  [threadFirst](./compose.threadfirst.md) | Takes an <code>init</code> value and a number of functions and/or function tuples, consisting of: <code>[fn, ...args]</code>. Executes each function (or tuple) with the return value of the previous expression inserted as first argument, using <code>init</code> for the first expression. |
|  [threadLast](./compose.threadlast.md) | Takes an <code>init</code> value and a number of functions and/or function tuples, consisting of: <code>[fn, ...args]</code>. Executes each function (or tuple) with the return value of the previous expression inserted as last argument, using <code>init</code> for the first expression. |
|  [trampoline](./compose.trampoline.md) | Takes a function returning either a no-arg function (thunk) or its already realized (non-function) result. Re-executes thunk for as long as it returns another function/thunk. Once a non-function result has been produced, <code>trampoline</code> returns that value itself. |

## SamplingOpts.theta property

Defines the target angle between sampled points. If greater than the actual range of the arc, only the two end points will be returned at most. This option is used to derive a `num` value and takes priority if `num` is given as well.

This option is useful to adapt the sampling based on angular resolution, rather than a fixed number of samples.

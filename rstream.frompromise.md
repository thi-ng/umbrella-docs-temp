## fromPromise variable

Yields a single-value [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of the resolved promise and then automatically marks itself done.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
fromPromise: <T>(src: Promise<T>, opts?: Partial<CommonOpts> | undefined) => Stream<T>
```

## Remarks

It doesn't matter if the promise resolves before the first subscriber has attached.

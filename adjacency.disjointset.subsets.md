## DisjointSet.subsets() method

Returns a `Map` of all subsets (connected components) with their canonical tree root IDs as keys and arrays of node IDs as values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
subsets(): Map<number, number[]>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`Map<number, number[]>`

## Remarks

If only the number of subsets is required, use the `count` property of this class instance instead (O(1), updated with each call to [DisjointSet.union()](./adjacency.disjointset.union.md)<!-- -->).

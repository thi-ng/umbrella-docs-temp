## ForkJoinOpts.interrupt property

If true, the workers will be terminated and restarted for each new input stream value. This is useful to avoid executing extraneous work and ensures only the most rececent stream value is being processed.

IMPORTANT: Please note that `forkJoin` does NOT handle backpressure at all. If `interrupt` is false, it's the user's responsibility to ensure that the input stream does NOT operate on a higher frequency than workers can produce results or else undefined behavior WILL occur!

Default: false

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
interrupt?: boolean;

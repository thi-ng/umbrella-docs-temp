## timeout variable

Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) that calls the [ISubscriber.error](./rstream.isubscriber.error.md) handlers of all child subscriptions with an arbitrary error object after a given time.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
timeout: <T>(timeoutMs: number, opts?: Partial<TimeoutOpts> | undefined) => Subscription<T, T>
```

## Remarks

If no `error` is given, uses a new `Error` instance by default. If `resetTimeout` is false (default), the error is emitted regardless of any received values in the meantime. However, if `true`<!-- -->, the timeout resets with each received value and then only triggers once the time interval since the last value has exceeded.

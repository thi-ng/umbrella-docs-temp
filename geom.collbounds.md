## collBounds variable

Computes the total bounds for the given shape collection, which should either contain only 2D or 3D types. No mixed dimensions are allowed! Currently the [bounds](./geom.bounds.md) function MUST be passed in as arg to avoid circular module dependencies.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
collBounds: (shapes: IShape[], bounds: Fn<IShape, AABBLike | undefined>) => import("@thi.ng/vectors").Vec[] | undefined
```

## History.undo() method

Attempts to re-apply most recent historical value to atom and returns it if successful (i.e. there's a history).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
undo(): T | undefined;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`T | undefined`

## Remarks

Before the switch, first records the atom's current value into the future stack (to enable [History.redo()](./atom.history.redo.md) feature). Returns `undefined` if there's no history.

If undo was possible, the `History.EVENT_UNDO` event is emitted after the restoration with both the `prev` and `curr` (restored) states provided as event value (and object with these two keys). This allows for additional state handling to be executed, e.g. application of the "Command pattern". See [History.addListener()](./atom.history.addlistener.md) for registering event listeners.

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [bisect](./rstream.bisect.md) | Returns a [PubSub](./rstream.pubsub.md) using given predicate <code>pred</code> as boolean [topic function](./rstream.pubsubopts.topic.md) and <code>truthy</code> &amp; <code>falsey</code> as subscribers for their respective values. |
|  [forkBuffer](./rstream.forkbuffer.md) | Higher-order fork function for scenarios involving the split-parallel processing of a large buffer. |
|  [forkJoin](./rstream.forkjoin.md) | Returns a [StreamSync](./rstream.streamsync.md) instance which creates &amp; attaches multiple subscriptions to given <code>src</code> input stream, processes each received value in parallel via web workers, then recombines partial results and passes the resulting transformed value downstream. |
|  [fromAtom](./rstream.fromatom.md) | Yields [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of value changes in given [Atom-like state container](./atom.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [fromDOMEvent](./rstream.fromdomevent.md) | Same as [fromEvent](./rstream.fromevent.md)<!-- -->, however only supports well-known DOM event names. Returned stream instance will use corresponding concrete event type in its type signature, whereas [fromEvent](./rstream.fromevent.md) will only use the generic <code>Event</code>. |
|  [fromEvent](./rstream.fromevent.md) | Creates a [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of events attached to given element / event target and using given event listener options (same as supported by <code>addEventListener()</code>, default: false). |
|  [fromInterval](./rstream.frominterval.md) | Returns a [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of monotonically increasing counter values, emitted at given <code>delay</code> interval and up to the optionally defined max value (default: âˆž), after which the stream is closed. |
|  [fromIterable](./rstream.fromiterable.md) | Returns a [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of values from provided iterable, emitted at the given <code>delay</code> interval. |
|  [fromIterableSync](./rstream.fromiterablesync.md) | Creates a new [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of given iterable which synchronously calls <code>.next()</code> for each item of the iterable when the first (and in this case the only one) subscriber becomes available. Once the iterable is exhausted (MUST be finite!), then calls <code>.done()</code> by default, but can be avoided by passing <code>false</code> as last argument. |
|  [fromPromise](./rstream.frompromise.md) | Yields a single-value [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of the resolved promise and then automatically marks itself done. |
|  [fromPromises](./rstream.frompromises.md) | Wraps given iterable in <code>Promise.all()</code> to yield [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of results in same order as arguments, then closes. |
|  [fromRAF](./rstream.fromraf.md) | Yields [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) of a monotonically increasing counter, triggered by a <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> loop (only available in browser environments). |
|  [fromViewUnsafe](./rstream.fromviewunsafe.md) | Unchecked version of . Paths can be given as string or tuple. |
|  [fromWorker](./rstream.fromworker.md) | Returns a [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) which adds <code>message</code> and <code>error</code> event listeners to given <code>worker</code> and then emits received values. |
|  [inlineWorker](./rstream.inlineworker.md) |  |
|  [joinBuffer](./rstream.joinbuffer.md) | Higher-order join function for scenarios involving the split-parallel processing of a large buffer. |
|  [LOGGER](./rstream.logger.md) |  |
|  [makeWorker](./rstream.makeworker.md) |  |
|  [merge](./rstream.merge.md) | Returns a new [StreamMerge](./rstream.streammerge.md) subscription, consuming values from multiple inputs and passing received values on to any subscribers. |
|  [metaStream](./rstream.metastream.md) | Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which transforms each incoming value into a new [Stream](./rstream.stream.md)<!-- -->, subscribes to it (via an hidden / internal subscription) and then only passes values from that stream to its own subscribers. |
|  [nextID](./rstream.nextid.md) |  |
|  [optsWithID](./rstream.optswithid.md) |  |
|  [postWorker](./rstream.postworker.md) | Creates a [subscriber](./rstream.isubscriber.md) which forwards received values to given worker. |
|  [pubsub](./rstream.pubsub.md) | Topic based stream splitter. Applies <code>topic</code> function to each received value and only forwards it to the child subscriptions of the returned topic. |
|  [resolve](./rstream.resolve.md) | Creates a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which receives promises, buffers them and then passes their resolved values downstream. |
|  [setLogger](./rstream.setlogger.md) |  |
|  [sidechainPartition](./rstream.sidechainpartition.md) | Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which buffers values from <code>src</code> until side chain fires, then emits buffer (unless empty) and repeats process until either input is done. |
|  [sidechainToggle](./rstream.sidechaintoggle.md) | Returns [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which filters values from input based on values received from side chain. |
|  [subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) | Creates a new [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) instance, the fundamental datatype and building block provided by this package. |
|  [sync](./rstream.sync.md) | Similar to [StreamMerge](./rstream.streammerge.md)<!-- -->, but with extra synchronization of inputs. Before emitting any new values, [StreamSync](./rstream.streamsync.md) collects values until at least one has been received from \*all\* inputs. Once that's the case, the collected values are sent as labeled tuple object to downstream subscribers. |
|  [timeout](./rstream.timeout.md) | Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) that calls the [ISubscriber.error](./rstream.isubscriber.error.md) handlers of all child subscriptions with an arbitrary error object after a given time. |
|  [trace](./rstream.trace.md) | Helper [ISubscriber](./rstream.isubscriber.md) for inspection / debugging purposes. Simply logs received values to console, optionally with given <code>prefix</code>. |
|  [transduce](./rstream.transduce.md) | Returns a promise which subscribes to given input and transforms incoming values using given transducer <code>xform</code> and reducer <code>rfn</code>. |
|  [tunnel](./rstream.tunnel.md) | Returns a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which processes received values via the configured worker(s) and then passes values received back from the worker(s) downstream, thereby allowing workers to be used transparently for stream processing. |
|  [tween](./rstream.tween.md) | Takes an existing stream/subscription <code>src</code> and attaches new subscription which interpolates between incoming values from <code>src</code> using the given <code>mix</code> function. |
|  [tweenNumber](./rstream.tweennumber.md) | Convenience version of [tween](./rstream.tween.md) for its most common use case, tweening of numeric streams. |

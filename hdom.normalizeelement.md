## normalizeElement variable

Expands single hiccup element/component into its canonical form:

```
[tagname, {attribs}, ...children]

```
Emmet-style ID and class names in the original tagname are moved into the attribs object, e.g.:

```
["div#foo.bar.baz"] => ["div", {id: "foo", class: "bar baz"}]

```
If both Emmet-style classes AND a `class` attrib exists, the former are appended to the latter:

```
["div.bar.baz", {class: "foo"}] => ["div", {class: "foo bar baz"}]

```
Elements with `__skip` attrib enabled and no children, will have an empty text child element injected.

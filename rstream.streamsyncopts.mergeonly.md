## StreamSyncOpts.mergeOnly property

If true, \*no\* input synchronization (waiting for values) is applied and `StreamSync` will emit potentially partially populated tuple objects for each received input value. However, as with the default behavior, tuples will retain the most recent consumed value from other inputs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
mergeOnly: boolean;
```

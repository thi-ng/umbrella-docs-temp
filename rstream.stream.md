## stream() function

Creates a new [Stream](./rstream.stream.md) instance, optionally with given `StreamSource` function and / or options.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function stream<T>(opts?: Partial<CommonOpts>): Stream<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  opts | <code>Partial&lt;CommonOpts&gt;</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Stream<T>`

## Remarks

If a `src` function is provided, the function will be only called (with the `Stream` instance as single argument) once the first subscriber has attached to the stream. If the function returns another function, it will be used for cleanup purposes if the stream is cancelled, e.g. if the first / last subscriber has unsubscribed (depending on `closeOut` option). Streams are intended as (primarily async) data sources in a dataflow graph and are the primary construct for the various `from*()` functions provided by this package. However, streams can also be triggered manually (from outside the stream), in which case the user should call `stream.next()` to cause value propagation.

Streams (like [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md)<!-- -->) implement the [IDeref](./api.ideref.md) interface which provides read access to a stream's last received value. This is useful for various purposes, e.g. in combination with [@thi.ng/hdom](./hdom.md)<!-- -->, which supports direct embedding of streams (i.e. their values) into UI components (and will be deref them automatically). If the stream has not yet emitted a value, value caching is disabled or if the stream is done, it will deref to `undefined`<!-- -->.

## Example


```ts
a = stream((s) => {
    s.next(1);
    s.next(2);
    s.done()
});
a.subscribe(trace("a"))
// a 1
// a 2
// a done

// as reactive value mechanism
b = stream();
// or alternatively
// b = subscription();

b.subscribe(trace("b1"));
b.subscribe(trace("b2"));

// external / manual trigger
b.next(42);
// b1 42
// b2 42

```

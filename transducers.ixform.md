## IXform interface

Interface for types able to provide some internal functionality (or derive some related transformation) as [Transducer](./transducers.transducer.md)<!-- -->. Implementations of this interface can be directly passed to all functions in this package where a `Transducer` arg is expected.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface IXform<A, B> 
```

## Example


```
class Mul implements IXform<number, number> {
  constructor(public factor = 10) {}

  xform() { return map((x) => this.factor * x); }
}

transduce(new Mul(11), push(), range(4))
// [0, 11, 22, 33, 44]

// also usable w/ comp()
transduce(
  comp(
    drop(1),
    new Mul(11),
    takeNth(2)
  ),
  push(),
  range(4)
)
// [11, 33]

```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [xform()](./transducers.ixform.xform.md) | Returns type specific operation as transducer. Internally called by functions in this package which expect transducer args. Users don't need to call this manually. |

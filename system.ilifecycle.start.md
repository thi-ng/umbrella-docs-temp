## ILifecycle.start() method

Starts component. Defined as async method to simplify internal use of `await` for starting any child/sub-components. Usually called by [System.start()](./system.system.start.md) which synchronously starts all of its components in dependency order.

Returns false to indicate component startup failed and to cancel initialization of dependent components. Alternatively, an error can be thrown, but it's the user's responsibility to catch it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
start?(): Promise<boolean>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<boolean>`

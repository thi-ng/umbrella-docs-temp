## dsf variable

Oscillator using Discrete Summation Formula:

`y(t) = (1-a^2) * sin(2πt) / (1 + a^2 - 2a * cos(b * 2πt))`

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dsf: StatelessOscillator
```

## Remarks

`alpha` should be in \[0..1) interval, `beta` is used as factor for the base `freq` and used for the cosine modulation term. The default config for both params is 0.5, 1.0 respectively, creating a waveform similar to a bandlimited sawtooth. If both params are zero, the result is a pure sine.

Note: Higher `alpha` values cause an increasing number (and amplitude) of spikes in the waveform. Therefore, the higher the `alpha`<!-- -->, the lower `amp` should be to avoid excessive out-of-range values.

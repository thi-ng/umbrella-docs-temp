|  [\_\_drawPoly](./hdom-canvas.__drawpoly.md) | Shared internal helper for polygon &amp; polyline fns. |
|  [canvas](./hdom-canvas.canvas.md) | Special HTML5 canvas component which injects a branch-local hdom implementation for virtual SVG-like shape components / elements. These elements are then translated into canvas draw commands during the hdom update process.<!-- -->The canvas component automatically adjusts its size for HDPI displays by adding CSS <code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> properties and pre-scaling the drawing context accordingly before shapes are processed.<!-- -->Shape components are expressed in standard hiccup syntax, however with the following restrictions:<!-- -->- Shape component objects with life cycle methods are only partially supported, i.e. only the <code>render</code> &amp; <code>release</code> methods are used (Note, for performance reasons <code>release</code> methods are ignored by default. If your shape tree contains stateful components which use the <code>release</code> life cycle method, you'll need to explicitly enable the canvas component's <code>__release</code> attribute by setting it to <code>true</code>). - Currently no event listeners can be assigned to shapes (ignored), though this is planned for a future version. The canvas element itself can of course have event handlers as usual.<!-- -->All embedded component functions receive the user context object just like normal hdom components.<!-- -->For best performance, it's recommended to ensure all resulting shapes elements are provided in already normalized hiccup format (i.e. <code>[tag, {attribs}, ...]</code>). That way the <code>__normalize: false</code> control attribute can be added either to the canvas component itself (or to individual shapes / groups), and if present, will skip normalization of all children. |

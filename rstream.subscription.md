## subscription variable

Creates a new [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) instance, the fundamental datatype and building block provided by this package.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
subscription: <A, B>(sub?: ISubscriber<B> | undefined, opts?: Partial<SubscriptionOpts<A, B>> | undefined) => Subscription<A, B>
```

## Remarks

Most other types in rstream, including [Stream](./rstream.stream.md)<!-- -->s, are `Subscription`<!-- -->s and all can be:

- linked into directed graphs (sync or async &amp; not necessarily DAGs) - transformed using transducers (incl. support for early termination) - can have any number of subscribers (optionally each w/ their own transducers) - recursively unsubscribe themselves from parent after their last subscriber unsubscribed (configurable) - will go into a non-recoverable error state if none of the subscribers has an error handler itself - implement the [IDeref](./api.ideref.md) interface

Subscription behavior can be customized via the additional (optional) options arg. See `CommonOpts` and `SubscriptionOpts` for further details.

## Example


```ts
// as reactive value mechanism (same as with stream() above)
s = subscription();
s.subscribe(trace("s1"));
s.subscribe(trace("s2"), { xform: tx.filter((x) => x > 25) });

// external trigger
s.next(23);
// s1 23
s.next(42);
// s1 42
// s2 42

```

## subscription variable

Creates a new [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) instance, the fundamental datatype &amp; building block provided by this package ([Stream](./rstream.stream.md)<!-- -->s are [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md)<!-- -->s too). Subscriptions can be:

- linked into directed graphs (if async, not necessarily DAGs) - transformed using transducers (incl. early termination) - can have any number of subscribers (optionally each w/ their own transducer) - recursively unsubscribe themselves from parent after their last subscriber unsubscribed - will go into a non-recoverable error state if NONE of the subscribers has an error handler itself - implement the [IDeref](./api.ideref.md) interface

```
// as reactive value mechanism (same as with stream() above)
s = rs.subscription();
s.subscribe(trace("s1"));
s.subscribe(trace("s2"), tx.filter((x) => x > 25));

// external trigger
s.next(23);
// s1 23
s.next(42);
// s1 42
// s2 42

```

## ensureArray variable

Helper function to avoid unnecessary copying if `x` is already an array.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ensureArray: (x: any) => any[]
```

## Remarks

First checks if `x` is an array and if so returns it. Else attempts to obtain an iterator from `x` and if successful collects it as array and returns it. Throws error if `x` isn't iterable.

## intersection variable

Computes the intersection of sets `a` and `b` and writes results into new set or optionally given set `out` (assumed to be empty for correct results). If `out` is \*not\* given, the returned Set type will be that of `a` (provided it defines `Symbol.species`<!-- -->).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
intersection: <T>(a: Set<T>, b: Set<T>, out?: Set<T> | undefined) => Set<T>
```

## Channel.mergeTuples() method

Takes an array of channels to merge into new channel of tuples. Whereas `Channel.merge()` realizes a sequential merging with no guarantees about ordering of the output.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static mergeTuples(chans: Channel<any>[], out?: Channel<any>, closeOnFirst?: boolean, closeOutput?: boolean): Channel<any>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  chans | <code>Channel&lt;any&gt;[]</code> | source channels |
|  out | <code>Channel&lt;any&gt;</code> | result channel |
|  closeOnFirst | <code>boolean</code> | true, if result closes when first input is done |
|  closeOutput | <code>boolean</code> | true, if result closes when all inputs are done |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Channel<any>`

## Remarks

The output channel of this function will collect values from all channels and a new tuple is emitted only once a new value has been read from ALL channels. Therefore the overall throughput is dictated by the slowest of the inputs.

Once any of the inputs closes, the process is terminated and the output channel is closed too (by default).

## Example


```ts
Channel.mergeTuples([
  Channel.from([1, 2, 3]),
  Channel.from([10, 20, 30]),
  Channel.from([100, 200, 300])
]).consume();

// chan-0 : [ 1, 10, 100 ]
// chan-0 : [ 2, 20, 200 ]
// chan-0 : [ 3, 30, 300 ]
// chan-0 done

Channel.mergeTuples([
  Channel.from([1, 2, 3]),
  Channel.from([10, 20, 30]),
  Channel.from([100, 200, 300])
], null, false).consume();

```

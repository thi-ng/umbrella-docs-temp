## scope variable

Wraps the given AST node array in `scope` node, optionally as global scope (default false). The interpretation of the global flag is dependent on the target code gen. I.e. for GLSL / JS, the flag disables wrapping the scope's body in `{}`<!-- -->, but else has no difference. In general this node type only serves as internal mechanism for various control flow AST nodes and should not need to be used directly from user land code (though might be useful to create custom / higher level control flow nodes).

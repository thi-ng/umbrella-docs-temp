## convertTree variable

Takes a normalized hiccup tree of [@thi.ng/geom](./geom.md) or [@thi.ng/hdom-canvas](./hdom-canvas.md) shape definitions and recursively converts it into an hiccup flavor which is compatible for SVG serialization. This conversion also involves translation &amp; reorg of various attributes. Returns new tree. The original remains untouched, as will any unrecognized tree/shape nodes.

```typescript
convertTree: (tree: any) => any[]
```

## convertTree variable

Takes a normalized hiccup tree of  or  shape definitions and recursively converts it into an hiccup flavor which is compatible for SVG serialization. This conversion also involves translation &amp; reorg of various attributes. Returns new tree. The original remains untouched, as will any unrecognized tree/shape nodes.

## walk variable

Traverses given AST in depth-first order and applies `visit` and `children` fns to each node. Descends only further if `children` returns an array of child nodes. The `visit` function must accept 2 args: the accumulator (`acc`<!-- -->) given to `walk` and a tree node. The return value of `visit` becomes the new `acc` value, much like in a reduce operation. `walk` itself returns the final `acc`<!-- -->.

If `pre` is true (default), the `visit` function will be called prior to visiting a node's children. If false, the visitor is called on the way back up.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
walk: <T>(visit: Fn2<T, Term<any>, T>, children: Fn<Term<any>, Term<any>[] | undefined>, acc: T, tree: Term<any> | Term<any>[], pre?: boolean) => T
```

## seq package

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [iterator(src)](./seq.iterator.md) | Yields an ES6 iterable for given seq or seqable. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [aseq](./seq.aseq.md) | Returns a zero-copy [ISeq](./api.iseq.md) for the given array and optionally for defined index range only. |
|  [concat](./seq.concat.md) | Returns the concatenation sequence of given nullable  or [ISeqable](./api.iseqable.md) values. |
|  [concatA](./seq.concata.md) | Same as [concat](./seq.concat.md)<!-- -->, but optimized for nullable arraylike values. |
|  [cons](./seq.cons.md) | Returns a new <code>ISeq</code> with <code>head</code> prepended to (optional) <code>seq</code>. |
|  [ensureSeq](./seq.ensureseq.md) |  |
|  [isSeq](./seq.isseq.md) |  |
|  [isSeqable](./seq.isseqable.md) |  |
|  [lazyseq](./seq.lazyseq.md) | Returns a new lazily evaluated <code>ISeq</code> produced by given function <code>fn</code>, which is only realized when values are requested. The function is only called once (if at all) and its result cached. |
|  [rseq](./seq.rseq.md) | Similar to [aseq](./seq.aseq.md)<!-- -->, returns a zero-copy [ISeq](./api.iseq.md) for the given array, though in reverse order and optionally for defined index range only. |

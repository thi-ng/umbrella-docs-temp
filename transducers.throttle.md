## throttle() function

Similar to [filter()](./transducers.filter.md)<!-- -->, but works with possibly stateful predicates to achieve rate limiting capabilities. Emits only values when predicate returns a truthy value.

To support multiple instances of stateful predicates, the predicate itself must be wrapped in a no-arg function, which is called when the transducer initializes. Any stateful initialization of the predicate MUST be done in this function and the function MUST return a 1-arg function, the actual predicate applied to each value.

Also see: [throttleTime()](./transducers.throttletime.md)<!-- -->.

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  pred | <code>StatefulPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code> |  |

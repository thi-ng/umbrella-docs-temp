## joinBuffer variable

Higher-order join function for scenarios involving the split-parallel processing of a large buffer.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
joinBuffer: <A, B>(fn?: Fn<A, ArrayLikeIterable<B>> | undefined) => (parts: A[]) => B[]
```

## Remarks

The returned function is meant to be used as `join` function in a [ForkJoinOpts](./rstream.forkjoinopts.md) config, receives the processed result chunks from all workers (ordered by worker ID) and concatenates them back into a single result array.

The optional `fn` arg can be used to pick the actual result chunk from each worker result. This is useful if the worker result type is not an array and includes other data points (e.g. execution metrics etc.). If `fn` is not given, it defaults to the identity function (i.e. each worker's result is assumed to be an array).

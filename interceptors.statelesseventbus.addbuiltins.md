\#\#\# Handlers

currently none...

\#\#\# Side effects

\#\#\#\# `FX_CANCEL`

If assigned `true`<!-- -->, cancels processing of current event, though still applies any side effects already accumulated.

\#\#\#\# `FX_DISPATCH`

Dispatches assigned events to be processed in next frame.

\#\#\#\# `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`

Async wrapper for promise based side effects.

\#\#\#\# `FX_DISPATCH_NOW`

Dispatches assigned events as part of currently processed event queue (no delay).

\#\#\#\# `FX_DELAY`

Async side effect. Only to be used in conjunction with `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`<!-- -->. Triggers given event after `x` milliseconds.

```
// this triggers `[EV_SUCCESS, "ok"]` event after 1000 ms
{ [FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC]: [FX_DELAY, [1000, "ok"], EV_SUCCESS, EV_ERROR] }

```
\#\#\#\# `FX_FETCH`

Async side effect. Only to be used in conjunction with `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`<!-- -->. Performs `fetch()` HTTP request and triggers success with received response, or if there was an error with response's `statusText`<!-- -->. The error event is only triggered if the fetched response's `ok` field is non-truthy.

```
// fetches "foo.json" and then dispatches EV_SUCCESS or EV_ERROR event
{ [FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC]: [FX_FETCH, "foo.json", EV_SUCCESS, EV_ERROR] }

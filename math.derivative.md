## derivative variable

Produces a new function which computes derivative of the given single-arg function. The extra optional arg `eps` is used to define the step width for computing derived values:

`f'(x) = (f(x + eps) - f(x)) / eps`

The original function is assumed to be fully differentiable in the interval the returned function is going to be used. No validity checks of any form are done.

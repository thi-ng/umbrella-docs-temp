## mixHermite variable

Returns hermite interpolation of `a, b, c, d` at normalized position `t`<!-- -->, where `a` and `d` are used as predecessor/successor of `b` / `c` and only inform the tangent of the interpolation curve. The interpolated result is that of `b` and `c`<!-- -->.

Assumes all inputs are uniformly spaced. If that's not the case, use `mixCubicHermite()` with one of the tangent generators supporting non-uniform spacing of points.

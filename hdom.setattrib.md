## setAttrib variable

Sets a single attribute on given element. If attrib name is NOT an event name (prefix: "on") and its value is a function, it is called with given `attribs` object (usually the full attrib object passed to `setAttribs`<!-- -->) and the function's return value is used as the actual attrib value.

Special rules apply for certain attributes:

- "style": delegated to `setStyle()` - "value": delegated to `updateValueAttrib()` - attrib IDs starting with "on" are treated as event listeners

If the given (or computed) attrib value is `false` or `undefined` the attrib is removed from the element.

```typescript
setAttrib: (el: Element, id: string, val: any, attribs?: any) => Element | undefined
```

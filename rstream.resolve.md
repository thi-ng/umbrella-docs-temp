## resolve variable

Creates a [Subscription](./rstream.subscription.md) which receives promises, buffers them and then passes their resolved values downstream.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
resolve: <T>(opts?: Partial<ResolverOpts> | undefined) => Resolver<T>
```

## Remarks

If the optional `fail` handler is provided, it'll be called with the error of each failed promise. If none is provided, the sub's [ISubscriber.error](./rstream.isubscriber.error.md) handler is called, which then stops the sub from receiving further values.

## Example


```ts
fromIterable([1, 2, 3], 100)
  .transform(tx.delayed(1000))
  .subscribe(resolve())
  .subscribe(trace("result"))
// result 1
// result 2
// result 3
// result done

```

## resolve variable

Creates a new subscription which receives promises, buffers them and then passes their resolved values downstream. If the optional `fail` handler is provided, it'll be called with the error of each failed promise. If none is provided, the sub's `error()` handler is called, which then stops the sub from receiving further values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
resolve: <T>(opts?: Partial<ResolverOpts> | undefined) => Resolver<T>
```

## Example


```ts
fromIterable([1, 2, 3], 100)
  .transform(tx.delayed(1000))
  .subscribe(resolve())
  .subscribe(trace("result"))
// result 1
// result 2
// result 3
// result done

```

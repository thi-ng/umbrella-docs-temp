## cases variable

Higher order word. Takes an object of stack programs with keys in the object being used to check for equality with TOS. If a match is found, executes corresponding stack program. If a `default` key is specified and no other cases matched, run `default` program. In all other cases throws an error.

Important: The default case has the original TOS re-added to the d-stack before execution.
